# Mini-Projects
Mini projects that I build during my learning process.

Stronger Name - 
1. Defines the alphabet by creating list of vowels and consonants.
2. Program takes user input to recieve two names (your name, and another)
3. Function name_math converts input name from a string into an integer by adding +1 for every letter and x2 for every vowel.
4. Names are replaced with the new integer 
5. Program compares the two (names) and prints whether your name is strong or not, based on the name with the largest integer.
